3. Write down the queries for the English queries that are listed later. Execute each query and display its results. 
   Capture your commands in spool files for turning in.
   
  1. Print the name and address of branch that serves the largest loan
  QUERY : SELECT D.NAME, D.ADDR FROM (select B.NAME, BB.ADDR,MAX(L.AMOUNT) AS MAX_LOAN 
		FROM BANK AS B, BANK_BRANCH AS BB, LOAN AS L WHERE L.BNO = BB.BRANCHNO AND B.CODE = BB.BCODE 
			group by BB.BRANCHNO order by MAX_LOAN desc LIMIT 1) AS D;
  
  2. Retrieve  the  name  and  address  of  customers  who  have  largest  account  net  balance  (account balance â€“ loan)
  QUERY : SELECT C.NAME, C.ADDR 
          FROM (
			SELECT A.BALANCE - L.AMOUNT AS BALANCE, C.NAME, C.ADDR
				FROM ACCOUNT AS A
					JOIN ACCOUNT_CUSTOMER AS AC
						ON A.ACCTNO = AC.ACCTNO
						JOIN CUSTOMER AS C
						ON C.SSN = AC.SSN
						JOIN LOAN_CUSTOMER AS LC
						ON LC.SSN = AC.SSN
						JOIN LOAN AS L
						ON L.LOANNO = LC.LOANNO
					) AS C 
			 ORDER BY C.BALANCE DESC
		   LIMIT 1;
					
  3. Print name and address of top 10 branches in having accounts as well as serving loans
  QUERY : SELECT B.NAME, BB.ADDR 
			FROM BANK AS B JOIN BANK_BRANCH AS BB ON B.CODE = BB.BCODE,
				(SELECT BNO, COUNT(BNO) as loan_count
					FROM LOAN
					group by BNO
					order by loan_count desc limit 10) AS K,
					(SELECT BNO, COUNT(BNO) as account_count
					FROM ACCOUNT
					group by BNO
					order by account_count desc LIMIT 10) AS L
				where BB.BRANCHNO = L.BNO and K.BNO = BB.BRANCHNO;	
				
  4. Retrieve  the  name  and  address  of  branches  having  net  account  deficit  and  sort  them  in  the largest to smallest deficit
  QUERY : SELECT NAME, ADDR,
			SUM(A.BALANCE) - SUM(l.AMOUNT) 
				AS Calculation
					FROM BANK B LEFT OUTER JOIN ACCOUNT A ON B.CODE = A.BCODE LEFT OUTER JOIN
				LOAN l ON B.CODE = l.BCODE GROUP BY NAME, ADDR ORDER BY CALCULATION DESC;
				
  5. List  out  the  bank  having  minimum  number  of  branches  but  at  the  same  time  having  largest account surplus
  QUERY : SELECT DISTINCT q1.total_branch,q2.account_surplus,q3.CODE,q3.NAME 
			FROM (SELECT COUNT(BRANCHNO) as total_branch,BCODE  FROM BANK_BRANCH bb GROUP BY bb.BCODE ORDER BY total_branch ASC) as q1,
				(SELECT COUNT(ACCTNO) as ac,BNO,SUM(BALANCE) as account_surplus,BCODE  FROM ACCOUNT a GROUP BY a.BNO,a.BCODE) as q2,
				(SELECT b.CODE,b.NAME  from BANK b) as q3
			WHERE q1.BCODE = q2.BCODE AND q2.BCODE = q3.CODE AND q3.CODE = q1.BCODE ORDER BY q2.account_surplus DESC;
			
  6. List the bank who supports largest number of branches supporting home loans
  QUERY : select B.NAME from BANK as B, (select BCODE, COUNT(BCODE) as branches 
		FROM LOAN WHERE TYPE = 'Home Loan' group by BCODE order by branches) as BR where B.CODE = BR.BCODE;
